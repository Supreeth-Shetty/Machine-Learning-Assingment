Training a generalized machine learning model means, in general, it works for all subset of unseen data. An example is when we train a model to classify between dogs and cats. If the model is provided with dogs images dataset with only two breeds, it may obtain a good performance. But, it possibly gets a low classification score when it is tested by other breeds of dogs as well. This issue can result to classify an actual dog image as a cat from the unseen dataset. Therefore, data diversity is very important factor in order to make a good prediction"

    "Ans : Regression analysis is a statistical method that helps us to analyze and understand the relationship between two or more variables of interest. The process that is adapted to perform regression analysis helps to understand which factors are important, which factors can be ignored, and how they are influencing each other.\n",

    "* **Correcting Errors** : Regression is not only great for lending empirical support to management decisions but also for identifying errors in judgment.For example, a retail store manager may believe that extending shopping hours will greatly increase sales. RA, however, may indicate that the increase in revenue might not be sufficient to support the rise in operating expenses due to longer working hours (such as additional employee labor charges). Hence, this analysis can provide quantitative support for decisions and prevent mistakes due to manager’s intuitions.\n",
    "* **New Insights** : Over time businesses have gathered a large volume of unorganized data that has the potential to yield valuable insights. However, this data is useless without proper analysis. RA techniques can find a relationship between different variables by uncovering patterns that were previously unnoticed. For example, analysis of data from point of sales systems and purchase accounts may highlight market patterns like increase in demand on certain days of the week or at certain times of the year. You can maintain optimal stock and personnel before a spike in demand arises by acknowledging these insights."
